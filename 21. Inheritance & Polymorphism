/* Inheritance:

- Relationship between multiple classes. 

- Allows functionality to be extended from once class to many.

- In Java, there is only single inheritance (C++ has multiple inheritance).




Polymorphism:

- An ability to be dealt with as either subclass or superclass. 

- When instantiating a subclass, you can declare it as a superclass type. 
  When a method requires a superclass, you can pass the subclass object.
